You're probably wondering that your self. Our answer: Minecraft is not suited  for what it has become. 
Minecraft was a smash hit and received a massive amount of support from a community, far exceading what it was envisioned for, which lead to lacklust support for what the community wanted as fans could not directly improve the engine. Modding became minecraft largest community, but recieved no offical support, thus mods need to be updated at every release.

We aim to create a technically superior voxel engine, in order to address the short commings of minecraft.



For example:

0. A mod API is our main and formost feature, modules are easily created, easily added, and do not break beween versions. For end users all module adding, updating, and downloading is handled through a simple GUI at world creations. Dependancies are automatic, and mods are automatically added at server join. Module packs exist for a tested and packaged experiance.

0. The creation of modules is simple, and if  behavior already exists, in libraries or frameworks, no java code is needed. Json is used heavily.

0. A tiny core, all content should be added using modules. Freedom of gameplay

0. Infinite height and depth, commonly know as Cubic Chunks

0. Blocks and block shapes are seperate. Once you define a shape, all blocks will have that variation. 

0. 65,000 IDs for biomes, A biome is defined per gride space, allowing for vertical biomes.

0. Community controlled and community ran. 

0. Open source and gratis. All currently existing modules as currently as well, but the licenses is to be decided by the Author. 

 

To prevent the duplication of work, we have a nice selection of frameworks and libraries. No longer will you have to worry about ores or compatability, we have an ore/mineral library of 121. As well as a collection of other libraries and frame works. Like a Soils and sand one, a one to add genetics, one for plants/trees and growing, one for weather/climate. 

Its recommend you look at the modules yourself to see how they're made, and tweak an add to them. Perhaps even contributing to them if you think it fits. So in the act of good will, it'd be nice if you made your modules gratis, and open source (under apache 2.0) so others can learn, improve, and in general just reduce the amount of work needed. After all, you could put your plant in the plant library, and everyone could help improve it and maintain it, and easy compatability between modules is achieved. . 

So if you're a wannabe mod creator, Terasology is right for you. Come look at these sands, https://github.com/Terasology/Soils/tree/master/assets/blockTiles/auto/sands , they're new simple blocks being created by litterally putting a texture in a folder, no coding needed. 

Look at this, https://github.com/Terasology/Soils/blob/master/assets/blockTiles/fancy/BlackSand.png A fancy block has been created simply by giving it a texture, and defing some properties in a textfile in json https://github.com/Terasology/Soils/blob/master/assets/blocks/fancy/BlackSand.block 


If you're not creating new behaviors, you won't need to do any java coding at all. Which, is again, a reason for everyone to help contribute to libraries, less duplication of work, and more time for things  you actually want to do.
