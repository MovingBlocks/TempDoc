This article will give an overview of the TS Crafting System, provided by the "Crafting"-module by @Adeon.

# General Information
We made the decision not to stick with a conventional solution via GUI for the crafting system but introduced an intuitive and innovative in-game approach. 
The crafting "place" is made up of 27 smaller blocks, placed in a 3x3x3 cube. By doing this, we achieve the possibility of three dimensional crafting. The crafting process itself is similar to known systems -- one places blocks/items in the crafting grid and - based on some recipe - can receive some craft result.

# Usage
To start a crafting process, you have to hold the "Q" key while holding a block or item in hand so that you see the charge indicator. When "right clicking" during charging, the craft blocks appears in front of you, with one instance of the item hold in hand already placed in the grid.
