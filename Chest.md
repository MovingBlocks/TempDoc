A *chest* is a block with some special functionality, namely it has in inventory. It can be placed like any other block.

# Usage
After placing the chest it can be activated by targeting it and pressing **E**. The player can store all kinds of blocks
 and items in a chest. Allthough, the provided space is limited to 30 slots.

By using **Shift + Left click** one can move a complete stack from the inventory to the chest and vice versa. The other

# Startup Chests

Since !Version? the player has initially a chest in its toolbar. This _startup chest_ contains some items to play around with,
so that the player does not have to use the command line right from the beginning. The _startup chest_ contains a second chest,
which has some interesting items stored as well.
