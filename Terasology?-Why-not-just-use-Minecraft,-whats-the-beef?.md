You're probably wondering that your self. Our answere: minecraft is not suited very well for what it has now become. 

In responce we created a voxel engine that is free as in freedom, there is no over arking company that can force items to be added, removed, or changes to be accepted or rejected. You can legally create your own version (fork) of Terasology is you feel that development is not going fast enough, or not going in your favor. More so, with some small exceptions (an intresting exception being the inbetweelands module, which is strictly an asset module, as we are teamed with the InbetweenLands devs, and have been granted permission to create a version for Terasology. No code base exists for that yet as its mostly librarys, frameworks, and discussion right now)  , all modules are also free as in freedom. 

With that in mind, Terasology and it's modules are also free as in cost, known as gratis. 


This is in sharp contrast to Minecraft, which you need to pay a sum of money just to own, and are restricted on what you can do with the code. 

Now, unless you install mods or develope mods, this means nothing for you. You've already bought minecraft, and you're happy, even happier if you're a windows10 user and got the windows10 version for free. 

Well, we do have _Cubic Chunks._
