Inventory
----------

There are a fair bit of nice shortcuts that work in the inventory

* Using the mousewheel over an item stack will add/remove items from it
    * Left-CTRL will do so at double speed (2 items at a time)
* Shift-clicking on an item will insta-move it from one side to another in a transfer (like inventory to chest) - or should that be made CTRL instead?
* Right-clicking an item stack will pick up half of it (or drop a single item if used with a stack held over an empty or compatible stack)
