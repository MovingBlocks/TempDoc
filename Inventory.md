The *Inventory* is the main GUI element the player interacts with. It holds all items and blocks the player collected
and gained in the game.

# Structure

# Usage
The inventory can be opened by pressing `I` (default, can be changed in the settings). You will then see the inventory
screen as described in the section above.

## Keybindings/ Short Cuts
You can make use of several short cuts available in the inventory screen. These are:

* Using the *mousewheel* over an item stack will add/remove items from it and attach it to the cursor
    * *Left-CTRL* will do so at double speed (2 items at a time)
* *Right-clicking* an item stack will pick up half of it (or drop a single item if used with a stack held over an empty
or compatible stack)

For more short cuts in combination with a [[Chest]] see the appropriate section.
