The **Grammar System** (or **Grammar Building System**) uses the [[Procedural Architecture Grammar]] to generate building structures. It
is included in versions starting from stable #22.

# Building Generator
Building Generators are used to create a [[Block Collection]] which can then be placed in the world. For the generation process,
the structure's dimension and a proper [[grammar|Procedural Architecture Grammar]] is needed. Please refeer to the corresponding sites
for more information.

# Console Commands
The Grammar System provides console commands to test the building generation. At the moment the system is quite restricted. You can only
call a pre defined generator with specifying width, depth and height of the building. To do so, just type
```\build <width> <heigth> <depth>```
in the [[Console|Console Help]]. The generated building will be placed right in front of the player.
