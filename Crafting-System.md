This article will give an overview of the TS Crafting System, provided by the "Crafting"-module by @Adeon.

# General Information
We made the decision not to stick with a conventional solution via GUI for the crafting system but introduced an intuitive and innovative in-game approach. 
The crafting "place" is made up of 27 smaller blocks, placed in a 3x3x3 cube. By doing this, we achieve the possibility of three dimensional crafting. The crafting process itself is similar to known systems -- one places blocks/items in the crafting grid and - based on some recipe - can receive some craft result.

# Usage
To start a crafting process, you have to hold the **Q** key while holding a block or item in hand so that you see the charge indicator. When **right clicking** during charging, the craft blocks appears in front of you, with one instance of the item hold in hand already placed in the grid.

The craft block is divided into 3 layers -- bottom, middle and top -- to make the placement of blocks/item practicable to the user. To place the selected block/item in the grid, point with the crosshair on a specified cell and **right click**. If the cell is empty, the selected item will be inserted into the grid. If the cell does already contain an element of the selected type, the counter in the matrix is incremented by one. In the last case, if there is already an element in the cell which is different from the selected one, nothing will happen. If the could successfully be placed, the amount of the selected block/item in the player's toolbar is decreased by one unit.

You can get placed blocks/items back by selecting them via the crosshair and **left clicking** on your mouse.
