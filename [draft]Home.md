Welcome to the Terasology Wiki!
===============================
Game Info
---------

_What is Terasology ?_ Founded by Benjamin 'begla' Glatzel as an open source tech demo to research procedural terrain generation a team is now taking it to the next level - a full fledged game. We're aiming for a survival and discovery game with a strong influence from Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, and Dungeon Keeper. A key part of the game will be building up an estate of some sort and managing specialized minions to climb up the ladder of discovery,
 while surviving in a world that might just be full of things that want to kill you.
