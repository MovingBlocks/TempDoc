This article will give an overview of the TS Crafting System, provided by the "Crafting"-module by @Adeon.

# General Information
We made the decision not to stick with a conventional solution via GUI for the crafting system but introduced an intuitive and innovative in-game approach. 
The crafting "place" is made up of 27 smaller blocks, placed in a 3x3x3 cube. By doing this, we achieve the possibility of three dimensional crafting. The crafting process itself is similar to known systems -- one places blocks/items in the crafting grid and - based on some recipe - can receive some craft result.

# Usage
This sections explains the main usage of the crafting system, including information on how to start the crafting process, how to effectively use the available features and how to actually craft new items.

## Start crafting process
To start a crafting process, you have to hold the **Q** key while holding a block or item in hand so that you see the charge indicator. When **right clicking** during charging, the craft blocks appears in front of you, with one instance of the item hold in hand already placed in the grid.

## The craft block (Add and remove items)
The craft block is divided into 3 layers -- bottom, middle and top -- to make the placement of blocks/item practicable to the user. To place the selected block/item in the grid, point with the crosshair on a specified cell and **right click**. If the cell is empty, the selected item will be inserted into the grid. If the cell does already contain an element of the selected type, the counter in the matrix is incremented by one. In the last case, if there is already an element in the cell which is different from the selected one, you will get the full amount of the placed block back to your inventory and a single instance of the selected block/item in hand is placed in the grid. 
If the block/item could successfully be placed, the amount of the selected block/item in the player's toolbar is decreased by one unit.

You can get placed blocks/items back by selecting them via the crosshair and **left clicking** on your mouse. 

## Add and remove multiple items
Furthermore, you can **hold the right or left mouse button** pressed to add or delete items continuously. Another way of adding a higher number of items to the grid at the same time is to hold **Q** to charge the number of items that will be added. The graduation is divided into 6 parts, each stands for 1/6 of the amount of items. Thus, charging to the half circle around the crosshair will place the half of the items in the grid. 

## Mini-Inventory
You may have noticed that you only have the items in your toolbar available for crafting. This difficulty was solved by the so called _mini-inventory_, which allows to scroll easily through your inventory. To access the mini-inventroy, press and hold **shift* and use the **mouse wheel** to scroll through the rows of your inventory. 

## Crafting
Now you know how to handle the crafting system, so we can start with the actual crafting. If you have arranged the blocks and items in the craft grid in a way such that the current configuration matches with some recipe, a _thought cloud_ appears over the craft block, containing an icon hint to the craft result. 
In order to receive the item, press **E** and you will get one (or another number, specified by the recipe) of the result item to your inventory. The amount of the used items in the craft block is decreased simultaneously.
