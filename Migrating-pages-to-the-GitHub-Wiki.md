We've previously used two different wikis - an old Foswiki instance on our old webhost (before it was melted by Gronkh) and the light-weight wiki addon for Xenforo.

We gave the XF wiki a try rather than reinstall Foswiki, but it turned out to be too feature poor. So we went to the GitHub wiki here instead, but not before several new pages were created, some of the content from there may overlap with old Foswiki content and new GitHub content, use best judgement in comparing to find out which is more up to date ...

## From Xenforo Wiki

Nothing migrated yet. Wiki is located [here](http://forum.movingblocks.net/wiki/index/).

## From old Foswiki

Most have either previously been imported or were idea pages that really need to go to the forum instead (this wiki isn't for "pending" stuff or "maybes")
