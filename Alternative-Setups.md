# Alternative Git setups

## Plain HTTPS (no SSH)
If you prefer not to use SSH you have to change ever `git@github.com:<user>` to `https://github.com/<user>`. When pushing changes to your fork you will be asked to enter your username and password for GitHub. Your password can be cached by a credential helper, see https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git for more details.

## GitHub application (Windows, Mac)
An alternative to the Git command line tool is the GitHub application for Windows (http://windows.github.com/) or Mac (http://mac.github.com/). 

The application will set up Git and the SSH key for GitHub for you. When logged in to your GitHub account in the application you will see your fork of the repository. To clone the repo to your hard drive just click "clone". You can change the destination via the settings menu. 

After cloning was successful you will find the clonde repo under "local". If desired, you can change the branch via the application as well.
