A *chest* is a block with some special functionality. It can be placed like any other block.

After placing the chest it can be activated by targeting it and pressing **E**. The player can then store items in it.

## Startup Chests

Since !Version? the player has initially a chest in its toolbar. This _startup chest_ contains some items to play around with,
so that the player does not have to use the command line right from the beginning. The _startup chest_ contains a second chest,
which has some interesting items stored as well.
